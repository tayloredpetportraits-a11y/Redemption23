***

## **Taylored Pet Portraits - Redemption Portal**

### **Project Overview**
A customer-facing redemption portal where pet portrait customers can view, select, and download their custom AI-generated portraits. This is a critical part of the customer journey after they purchase a portrait package.

### **Business Model Context**
- Customers purchase portrait packages at tayloredpetportraits.com
- We generate 5 unique digital portrait variations per order
- Customers receive a personal redemption link via email
- Through the portal, they can:
  - View all 5 portrait variations
  - Select their favorite for physical printing (8x10)
  - Download all 5 digital files for personal use
  - Share portraits on social media

### **Core Features Required**

**Customer Portal:**
- Unique redemption code/link authentication (no login required)
- Gallery view displaying all 5 portrait variations
- High-quality image display with zoom capability
- "Select Favorite" button for each portrait (marks choice for physical printing)
- Download all 5 portraits as high-res files (individual or batch download)
- Mobile-responsive design (most customers use phones)
- Social sharing buttons (Instagram, Facebook)
- Order details display (customer name, pet name, theme selected)

**Admin Portal:**
- Secure password authentication (password: admin123)
- Dashboard showing all active orders
- Upload portraits to customer orders
- Generate unique redemption links
- View customer selections
- Mark orders as fulfilled/shipped
- Customer communication log

### **Technical Requirements**

- **File Formats:** JPEG/PNG, high resolution (300 DPI for printing)

### **Database Schema Needed**
- **Orders table:** order_id, customer_email, customer_name, pet_name, theme, redemption_code, created_at, status
- **Portraits table:** portrait_id, order_id, image_url, is_selected, upload_date
- **Admin table:** admin authentication credentials

### **User Experience Priorities**
1. **Simple & intuitive** - customers aren't tech-savvy
2. **Fast loading** - high-res images must load quickly
3. **Mobile-first** - 70%+ of traffic is mobile
4. **Clear CTAs** - "Download All", "Select This One", "Share"
5. **Celebratory feeling** - this is an exciting moment for customers

### **Brand Guidelines**
- **Name:** Taylored Pet Portraits
- **Tagline:** "Redemption Portal"
- **Colors:** Keep elegant, pet-friendly (refer to tayloredpetportraits.com for brand colors)
- **Tone:** Warm, personal, celebratory
- **Accessibility:** Must be fully accessible (a11y compliant)

### **Current Issues to Fix**

- Preview not showing in Bolt interface  
- Need proper error handling for invalid redemption codes
- Mobile responsiveness optimization

### **Success Metrics**
